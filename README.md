# Udacity Disaster Response Pipelines

This is the second project for the Data Science NanoDegree on Udacity platform.
The idea behind this project is to be able to quickly identify a topic of a real human written text, using an multi label classifier.
### The goal for this projects were:
* Learn Natural Language Processing
* Learn how no create clean reusable solution for ML classifier using Pipelines
* Lean how to automate the project as a web app

### Natural Language Processing
The raw text supplied to the tool is cleaned, normalized and tokenzed by breaking sentences into single words.

### Pipelines 
To create a clean and reusable solution a pipeline is created. Pipelines are powerful helper of python science package sk-learn.
It helps chain multiple steps together and have a clean reusable peace of code to simplify a search for the best machine learning algorythm.

### Web App
Finally to simplify the user experience even further, a web app is created to automate the run of the solution.
